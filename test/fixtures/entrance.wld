The Courtyard Entrance~
   This is the entrance to this small, fortified camp.  To the north stands a
thick gate with a large lock built into it.  Tall, stone walls surround the
courtyard here, which extends all around.  Atop the wall to the east and west
are wooden watchtowers where guards scan the surrounding countryside watching
for trouble.  The main part of this keep lies to the south, where a two-story
building sits, a portcullis leading  into it.  Red and black banners atop the
walls flap in the breeze and several soldiers wearing the same colors parade
around and train for an eventual fight.
